### Step 2: Prepare to Upload
1. Click the "Add file" button (top right)
2. Select "Upload files" from the dropdown

### Step 3: Upload Files

2. You'll see a progress indicator
3. When complete, you'll see all files in your repository

## ‚úÖ Verify Upload Success

After uploading, check that these files are visible in your GitHub repository:

- [ ] Can you see the `src` folder?
- [ ] Can you see `index.html` in the root?
- [ ] Can you see `package.json` in the root?
- [ ] Can you see `netlify.toml` in the root?

If YES to all ‚Üí Upload successful! ‚úÖ

## üîÑ What Happens Next?

1. **Netlify Detects Changes**
   - Netlify automatically watches your GitHub repository
   - It will detect the new files immediately

2. **Automatic Build Starts**
   - Netlify will run: `pnpm install && pnpm run build`
   - This takes about 2-3 minutes

3. **Deployment Completes**
   - Your site will be live at rawtopianbliss.org
   - All changes will be visible

## üîç Check Netlify Deployment

1. Go to app.netlify.com
2. Sign in to your account
3. Find your "rawtopian-bliss" site
4. Look for "Production deploys" section
5. You should see a new deployment in progress or completed

### Deployment Status Indicators
- üü° **Building** - Netlify is building your site (wait 2-3 minutes)
- üü¢ **Published** - Your site is live! Visit rawtopianbliss.org
- üî¥ **Failed** - Check the build log for errors

## ‚ùå Common Upload Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Uploading Only Some Files
**Problem:** Only uploading `src` folder without root files
**Solution:** Make sure to upload ALL files including `index.html`, `package.json`, etc.

### Mistake 2: Wrong Folder Structure
**Problem:** Uploading files inside a nested folder
**Solution:** Files should be at the root level of your repository

### Mistake 3: Missing netlify.toml
**Problem:** Netlify doesn't know how to build the site
**Solution:** Make sure `netlify.toml` is in the root directory

## üÜò Need Help?

If you encounter issues:

1. **Upload Failed**
   - Check your internet connection
   - Try uploading fewer files at a time
   - Use GitHub Desktop app instead

2. **Build Failed on Netlify**
   - Check the Netlify build log
   - Verify all required files were uploaded
   - Make sure `netlify.toml` is correct

3. **Changes Not Visible**
   - Clear your browser cache
   - Wait 5 minutes for CDN cache to clear
   - Try viewing in incognito/private mode

## üéâ Success Indicators

You'll know everything worked when:

‚úÖ GitHub shows all your files
‚úÖ Netlify shows "Published" status
‚úÖ rawtopianbliss.org loads without errors
‚úÖ Header stays sticky when scrolling
‚úÖ Food descriptions are dark green
‚úÖ "DO YOU LIKE IT RAW?" appears in bold yellow
