## ‚úÖ What's Been Fixed

Your website now includes all the features you requested:

### 1. Sticky Header Navigation
The navigation bar stays fixed at the top of the screen as users scroll, just like sluttyveganatl.com. This provides easy access to navigation at all times.

### 2. "DO YOU LIKE IT RAW?" Bold Yellow Text
Eye-catching tagline in the hero section with bold yellow color (#ffcc00) that immediately grabs attention and reinforces your brand message.

### 3. Dark Green Food Descriptions
Food item descriptions now display in dark green (#1a3d0a) instead of white, making them much easier to read against the yellow background. This significantly improves readability and user experience.

### 4. Side-by-Side Button Layout
"Get Delivered" and "Get Shipped" buttons are now positioned horizontally next to each other, creating a cleaner, more professional call-to-action design.

### 5. Professional Navigation
Clean, centered navigation with your logo in the middle and links evenly distributed on either side, creating a balanced and professional appearance.
